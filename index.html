				Sri Dalada Maligawa (Sinhala: ශ්‍රී දළදා මාළිගාව) or The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is a Buddhist temple in the city of Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is located in the royal palace complex which houses the Relic of the tooth of Buddha. Since ancient times, the relic has played an important role in local politics because it is believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country. Kandy was the last capital of the Sinhalese kings and is a UNESCO world heritage site partly due to the temple. The temple which houses the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha is one of the holiest shrines in the entire Buddhist world.

				<h4>Itinerary</h4>
				This is a typical itinerary for this product<br/>

				<strong>Stop At</strong>: Weligama Fishtheraphy, 41, Kapuwatta Denipitiya, Matara 81730 Sri Lanka<br/>

				Complete your Galle day tour with a visit to see the amazing Stilt Fishermen in Weligama. The fishermen sit on a cross bar tied to a vertical pole which is planted in the coral reef and the stilt with one hand while seated and carry out rod and line fishing with the other hand. The practice of stilt fishing started about 50 years after the end of the Second World War when fishermen found that fishing off the rocks that protrude over the sea was not enough to catch fish in large numbers, so they started planting discarded metal pipes into the reef and using them to lean against and fish. Over time the fishermen discovered that timber worked just as well as developed the poles into the more modern day versions that we see today. It is a unique sight to behold and one that should not be missed as we watch and marvel at Man's dexterity to overcome any hurdle.<br/>

				Duration: 1 Hours<br/>

				<strong>Stop At</strong>: Jungle Beach, Unawatuna 80600 Sri Lanka<br/>
				climbed down toward the true destination of your day trip — Jungle Beach. Not another person in sight, just twin stretches of deserted sand trapped between the ocean and Rumassala Rock. Having just experienced the soul-crushing lameness of Unawatuna, this beach was exactly what we needed. Peace, solitude and gorgeous nature.<br>

				Duration: 1 Hours<br/>

				<strong>Stop At</strong>: Tsunami Photo Museum, Templeroad Just North of Hikkaduwa, Telwatta Sri Lanka<br/>

				Tsunami Photo Museum - Your next stop will be at the Tsunami Photo Museum which is located in Talwatte. After the devastating Tsunami of 2004, which struck Sri Lanka along with many other countries, the recovery process has been slow, long as well as arduous. The coastal areas were the worst hit and re-development still continues with physical as well psycho-social rehabilitation being one of the most important areas. To ease the process so that people can talk and articulate about the horrors of the Tsunami as well as to provide a place where beauty and art is still in abundance, the Tsunami Photo Museum was established. It is a completely charitable museum which provides free entrance and has drawings, paintings, photographs – art in all its glory – to tell a story of every individual to lived through the Tsunami of 2004.<br>
